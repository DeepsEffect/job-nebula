            Understanding Access Tokens and Refresh Tokens
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Access tokens and refresh tokens are essential components of
            authentication and authorization mechanisms in web applications.
            Access tokens are short-lived tokens that grant access to protected
            resources, while refresh tokens are long-lived tokens used to obtain
            new access tokens. They work together to provide secure access to
            APIs. It&apos;s crucial to store access tokens securely on the
            client side to prevent unauthorized access. One common approach is
            to use browser cookies with the HTTPOnly and Secure flags for
            improved security.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Express.js is a minimalist web application framework for Node.js. It
            simplifies the process of building web servers and APIs by providing
            a robust set of features and middleware. Express.js is known for its
            simplicity, flexibility, and scalability. With Express.js,
            developers can easily handle routing, middleware, request, and
            response processing. It&apos;s widely used in the Node.js ecosystem
            for building server-side applications, RESTful APIs, and web
            services.

          <p className="mb-4">
            Nest.js is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient,
            reliable, and scalable server-side applications. Inspired by
            Angular, Nest.js leverages TypeScript and follows a modular,
            dependency-injection based architecture. It provides out-of-the-box
            support for features like routing, middleware, authentication, and
            database integration. Nest.js simplifies the development process and
            encourages best practices such as separation of concerns and
            dependency injection. It&apos;s well-suited for building complex,
            enterprise-grade applications with ease.
